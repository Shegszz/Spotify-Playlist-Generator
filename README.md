# Spotify-Playlist-Generator
This project demonstrates API integration and data handling using Python to create a personalized Spotify playlist based on song popularity. The script fetches top songs from the Spotify API, sorts them by popularity, and adds the top 100 songs to a new playlist. Key features include data handling, algorithmic sorting, and projectÂ management.
